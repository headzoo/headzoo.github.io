    <p>Christopher
      Pitt
      asked
      a
      simple
      question:
      <a href=https://medium.com/@assertchris/can-a-developer-be-called-a-creative-f43f2278ba05 title>Can
        a
        developer
        be
        called
        a
        creative?</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I am talking
        about
        whether
        systems
        architects
        or
        PHP
        developers
        (like
        me!)
        can
        be
        called
        a
        creative,
        even
        though
        we
        predominantly
        deal
        with
        code,
        and
        our
        grasp
        of
        colours,
        layout
        and
        iconography
        is
        limited
        to
        the
        unicode
        characters
        we
        appropriate
        for
        console
        and
        log
        messages.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To be honest
      it
      never
      crossed
      my
      mind
      that
      programming
      was
      anything
      but
      a
      creative
      pursuit,
      and
      I’m
      happy
      to
      call
      myself
      an
      artist
      to
      anyone
      that
      will
      listen,
      but
      I
      understand
      why
      civilians
      (non-programmers)
      could
      see
      things
      differently.
    <p>A girlfriend
      once
      told
      me
      programming
      “looks
      boring”
      when
      I
      suggested
      learning
      a
      bit
      of
      JavaScript
      and
      HTML,
      and
      many
      years
      ago
      I
      was
      roommates
      with
      a
      painter,
      who,
      on
      hearing
      me
      proclaim
      my
      code
      was
      artwork,
      replied
      with
      a
      condescending,
      “Yeah,
      uh
      huh,
      sure!”
    <div>
    </div>
    <p>Yes, I
      get
      it.
      To
      the
      casual
      observer
      it
      may
      appear
      terribly
      dreary
      staring
      at
      a
      monitor
      all
      day
      and
      night,
      with
      the
      steady
      drone
      of
      click,
      click,
      click
      coming
      from
      a
      keyboard,
      and
      I
      understand
      why
      a
      classic
      artist
      (writer,
      painter,
      musician)
      may
      scoff
      at
      the
      idea
      of
      programming
      as
      an
      art
      form.
      No
      one
      is
      going
      to
      look
      at
      my
      finished
      work
      in
      a
      gallery,
      and
      discuss
      the
      artist’s
      soul
      while
      sipping
      expensive
      wine.
    <p>What people
      don’t
      see
      is
      the
      explosion
      of
      activity
      happening
      in
      my
      head
      while
      I
      stare
      at
      those
      bright
      monitors
      with
      my
      bloodshot
      eyes.
      I’ve
      never
      surfed
      the
      waves
      of
      Hawaii,
      but
      I
      get
      an
      adrenaline
      rush
      from
      conquering
      problems.
      I’ve
      never
      played
      a
      hit
      single
      to
      a
      crowed
      of
      adoring
      fans — and
      certainly
      never
      had
      a
      hot
      groupie
      throw
      their
      bra
      at
      me — but
      I
      know
      the
      feeling
      of
      being
      taken
      to
      a
      higher
      conscience
      level
      when
      I
      get
      into
      a
      groove.
    <p>I know
      passion
      and
      excitement,
      and
      I
      know
      what
      it’s
      like
      to
      feel
      drained,
      exhausted,
      high,
      and
      elated
      when
      a
      project
      is
      finished.
      Most
      importantly
      though,
      I
      know
      how
      nerve-racking
      it
      can
      be
      to
      finally
      give
      my
      work
      to
      the
      world.
      Will
      people
      love
      it
      or
      hate
      it?
      Will
      people
      understand
      and
      appreciate
      the
      nuance
      of
      my
      work,
      or
      will
      they
      think
      it’s
      boring
      and
      stupid?
    <p>Make no
      mistake
      about
      it,
      programming
      is
      a
      creative
      pursuit,
      and
      I
      am
      an
      artist.
      I
      may
      work
      with
      a
      keyboard
      and
      IDE
      instead
      of
      a
      paint
      brush
      or
      guitar,
      but
      I
      have
      the
      same
      passion
      and
      dreams
      as
      an
      artist,
      and
      I
      live
      and
      die
      by
      the
      acceptance
      or
      rejection
      of
      my
      work
      by
      fans.
      My
      work
      may
      never
      be
      seen
      in
      a
      Soho
      art
      gallery,
      but
      it
      will
      be
      seen
      by
      millions
      of
      people.
    <p>Heck, I
      even
      occasionally
      sit
      back
      and
      admire
      my
      code
      while
      sipping
      expensive
      wine.
